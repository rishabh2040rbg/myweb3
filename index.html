  <h3>Lewis Hamilton</h3>
  <img src="images3/hamiltonhamilton.jpg" alt="Lewis Hamilton">
  <p>One of the most successful drivers in F1 history, Hamilton continues to lead the pack with his unmatched speed and skills.ewis Hamilton (born January 7, 1985, Stevenage, England) is one of the most successful Formula One (F1) Grand Prix racing drivers of all time. He owns the F1 record for career race victories and is tied with Michael Schumacher for the most drivers’ championships (seven). In 2008 he became the first Black driver to win the F1 world drivers’ championship.Hamilton was born in Stevenage, England, a town about 30 miles (48 km) north of London. He began his racing career when he was eight years old. He won the British Kart Championship when he was 10. Three years later Hamilton was signed to the McLaren and Mercedes-Benz Young Driver Support Programme, where he was given the support and backing he needed to train and develop his skills. From 1998 to 2000 he won European and world karting championships, and at age 15 he became the youngest-ever driver to be ranked number one in the sport.
Hamilton joined the McLaren F1 team in 2007. In his rookie season he came in second in the world drivers’ championship, only one point behind the winner, Kimi Räikkönen. His four race victories that year tied Jacques Villeneuve’s F1 record for most wins in a rookie season.
In 2008, at the age of 23, Hamilton won five races to secure the drivers’ championship. He finished just one point ahead of Felipe Massa. Hamilton was the youngest person to win the drivers’ championship until Sebastian Vettel won his first title in 2010.
In subsequent seasons with McLaren, Hamilton continued to be one of the top drivers on the F1 circuit, winning two races in 2009, three in 2010, three in 2011, and four in 2012. In September 2012 Hamilton decided to leave McLaren to join the Mercedes-Benz F1 team. He had some difficulty adjusting in his first season with Mercedes, winning just one race in 2013, but Hamilton nevertheless managed to rack up enough points to finish in the top five of the drivers’ championship standings for the seventh consecutive season.In 1995, a 10-year-old kart champion, wearing a borrowed suit and shoes, picked up two trophies at a motorsport awards ceremony in London. Brandishing an autograph book prepared by his father, he approached Ron Dennis, boss of the McLaren Mercedes Formula One team. "I said 'Hello Mr. Dennis, I'm Lewis Hamilton and one day I'd like to race for your team.' I asked him for his autograph and his phone number. He put them in my book and also wrote 'Call me in nine years.'"

The call was made just three years later and it was the Hamilton household's telephone that rang. It was Ron Dennis who presented Anthony with an offer to financially support his son's career for the forseeable future, with the proviso that Lewis should keep working hard at school. Lewis: "I just went upstairs to my room and got on with my homework. It was so unbelievable. I struggled to take it in."

  <h3>Max Verstappen</h3>
  <img src="images3/verstappenverstappen.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen">
  <p>A young and fierce competitor, Verstappen is known for his aggressive racing style and pursuit of victory.Max Emilian Verstappen  is a Dutch and Belgian racing driver who competes under the Dutch flag in Formula One for Red Bull Racing. Verstappen has won four Formula One World Drivers' Championship titles, which he won consecutively from 2021 to 2024 with Red Bull, and has won 64 Grands Prix across 11 seasons.

Born in Hasselt and raised in Maaseik, Verstappen is the son of Dutch former Formula One driver Jos Verstappen and Belgian former kart racer Sophie Kumpen. After a successful karting career—culminating in his record-breaking 2013 season—Verstappen graduated to junior formulae. Progressing directly to FIA European Formula 3, Verstappen broke several records on his way to third in the championship in his rookie season with Van Amersfoort. Aged 17, Verstappen signed for Toro Rosso in 2015 as part of the Red Bull Junior Team, becoming the youngest driver in Formula One history at the Australian Grand Prix. Following several points finishes in his debut season, Verstappen retained his seat for 2016 before being promoted to parent team Red Bull after four rounds. On debut for Red Bull, aged 18, Verstappen won the Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the youngest-ever driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix. Verstappen achieved multiple race wins in his 2017 and 2018 campaigns, before finishing third in both the 2019 and 2020 World Drivers' Championships under Honda power.

Verstappen won his maiden title in 2021 after overtaking Lewis Hamilton on the final lap of the last race of the season, becoming the first World Drivers' Champion from the Netherlands. Verstappen won the next two championships in 2022 and 2023, overturning the largest points deficit in Formula One history in the former and breaking numerous records across both seasons. He secured his fourth consecutive title in 2024 after winning nine Grands Prix, including a widely acclaimed wet-weather performance in São Paulo, to become the first driver to win the championship driving for a third-placed constructor in 41 years.

As of the 2025 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Verstappen has achieved 64 race wins, 42 pole positions, 33 fastest laps and 115 podiums in Formula One. In addition to being the youngest Grand Prix winner, he holds several Formula One records, including the most wins in a season (19), the most podium finishes in a season (21), the most consecutive wins (10), and the most consecutive pole positions . Verstappen is contracted to remain at Red Bull until at least the end of the 2028 season. [Verstappen was listed in the 2024 issue of Time as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 2022.</p>

   <h3>Charles Leclerc</h3>
   <img src="images3/leclercleclerc.jpg" alt="Charles Leclerc">
   <p>The rising star from Ferrari, Leclerc is known for his precision and consistency on the track.Charles Marc Hervé Perceval Leclerc was born on October 16, 1997, in Monte Carlo, Monaco, a tiny but iconic principality known for its glamour, affluence, and deep connection to motorsport. Growing up in Monaco, a country practically built around the Monaco Grand Prix, Leclerc was surrounded by the buzz of racing from a young age. But unlike the perception of Monaco’s elite, Leclerc’s path was far from easy. His family wasn't excessively wealthy, and much of his career in motorsport was made possible through talent, sacrifice, and key sponsorship backing.

Charles’s father, Hervé Leclerc, was a former racing driver who competed in Formula 3 during the 1980s and 1990s. His mother, Pascale, supported his ambitions from a young age, while his godfather and mentor, Jules Bianchi, played a profound role in shaping his outlook and career in motorsports. Bianchi, a fellow rising star in Formula 1, tragically passed away in 2015 after suffering a head injury during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix. His loss deeply affected Leclerc, but also inspired him to continue chasing his dream with even more determination.eclerc entered Formula 1 in 2018 with Sauber (now Alfa Romeo), a team that had finished last in the previous season’s standings. Despite being a rookie, Leclerc quickly became a standout performer. He consistently outqualified and outperformed his more experienced teammate, Marcus Ericsson, and helped lift the team to eighth in the constructors’ standings — an impressive jump considering their 2017 struggles.

His calm under pressure, consistency, and raw pace made headlines. One of his most memorable drives was at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, where he finished sixth, earning valuable points for the team. By the end of the season, Ferrari had seen enough — and in a move that shocked some traditionalists, they signed Leclerc to race for Scuderia Ferrari in 2019, replacing four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel.In 2023, Leclerc and Ferrari hoped to challenge Red Bull, but the team once again struggled with consistency. Leclerc remained strong in qualifying but often lacked the race pace or strategy support to secure wins. The season was marked by flashes of brilliance — strong drives, daring overtakes, and masterful tire management — but also a sense of frustration.

Heading into 2024, Ferrari showed improvement. With a more stable car and a new team principal, Frédéric Vasseur, the environment at Maranello seemed more aligned with Leclerc’s goals. Though still facing tough competition from Verstappen and Red Bull, Leclerc continued to be one of the most dependable and explosive drivers on the grid.</p>
